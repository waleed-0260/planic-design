    question: "What is 3D visualization, and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "3D visualization lets you see a lifelike model of your space before anything is built. It helps you visualize layouts, lighting, and finishes — and make decisions with clarity and confidence.",
  },
  {
    question: "What software or tools do you use for rendering?",
    answer:
      "We use industry-leading tools like SketchUp, 3ds Max, and Lumion to deliver high-quality, photo-realistic renderings that reflect every nuance of your design.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I request changes once I see the 3D model?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Your feedback is welcome. We offer revisions to fine-tune the model until it meets your vision and expectations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to get the 3D renderings?",
    answer:
      "Depending on project size, basic renderings can take a few days, while complex visuals may take a week. We always provide realistic timelines upfront.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is 3D visualization part of your design package, or a separate service?",
    answer:
      "It can be both. Many of our clients choose it as part of a design package, but it’s also available as a standalone service.",
  },
